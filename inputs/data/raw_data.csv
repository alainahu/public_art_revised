Revell was acquainted with the artist and suggested that one of his works would complement the flowing lines of the building. The Archer was selected from a group of Moore's maquettes (small models). However, the proposed purchase of the work with public funds ($100,000) erupted into controversy and was defeated in council. Eventually Mayor Phil Givens raised the artist's fee with private money. Henry Moore was so moved by this gesture of support for the purchase of his sculpture that he donated more than 200 sculptures, drawings and graphics to the Art Gallery of Ontario.

At the age of 18, Terry lost his leg to cancer. Believing that the only thing that can provide hope to a person with cancer is research, he decided to raise money by running a ""Marathon of Hope"" - one marathon (26.2 miles) a day, from St. John's, NL, to Vancouver, B.C.  Between April 12 and September 1, 1980, Terry made it two-thirds of the way across Canada - 3,339 miles, close to 143 marathons in a row - before his cancer returned and stopped the run. Nobody in recorded history has ever run as many consecutive marathons. Terry died within the year, on June 28, 1981. Partly because of the money he raised, and the money the Terry Fox Foundation raises annually with its run, Terry would not only be alive today were he to have the same cancer, but he would also have his leg. If there's a miracle to Terry's run, it is the miracle of perseverance, courage and grace in the face of unthinkable odds. Two laps of this park (marked with maple leaves), equals one mile. Please experience it as you will, and along the way, contemplate photos of items from Terry's family's collection and more thoughts about Terry and his 1980 run. - Douglas Coupland",None,Concord Adex Development Corporation,None,portrait,None,None,"{'type': 'MultiPoint', 'coordinates': [[-79.397085, 43.639534]]}"

Re-imagined by Canada Lands Company, Downsview Park is internationally recognized as one of the largest and most significant repurposing of post industrial land, originally marked by the 1999 international design competition won by Bruce Mau and Rem Koolhaas. Downsview Park is home to both open spaces and a multitude of metropolitan level public amenities, and will be ringed by newly developed residential neighborhoods and employment centers. Following a public art masterplan prepared by Andrew Davies Public Art Consulting, Groundswell constitutes the public art component of Stanley Greene, the first residential neighborhood to be built as part of the overall Downsview Park repurposing effort. Groundswell is based on the seasonal interactions of earth and water, the curious swelling of the bedrock underlying Toronto, and the upwelling and interweaving of cultures in Toronto as a whole. ""Groundswell: Southgate"" is comprised of several interrelated elements including sculpted benches, custom paving, and a sculpted retaining wall all created as if emerging from the ground; a distinct sculpture - Southgate Marker 2018 - forms the centerpiece of this area. The sculpture is comprised of interwoven metal components which support the growth of vines. The sculpted metal components blend a range of abstracted patterns that subtly reference textiles from some of the numerous cultures that live in the surrounding area. This contemporary filigree of intermixing patterns and textures with the sculpture's overall form and climbing vines is symbolic of both the mingling of diversity and it's rooting in a place. The reflection of sunlight and the complexity of shadows within and around the piece will vary over the course of each day and through the seasons, adding another layer of interplay. Counterpart to the cultural groundswell, the project plays off of the documented swelling of Toronto's shale bedrock as well as some of the minerals found in the region. Sculpted slab benches and walls rise from the ground as if through the swelling of the earth, their immense weight supported by an obscured base. Sculpted benches, a sculpted low retaining wall, and paving incorporate various patterns based on mineral formations from the region. These reliefs, such as one based on fluorite, are cast into the sculpted concrete pieces with the intention of surfacing and revealing otherwise buried complex natural formations. In this way, the swelling of the ground exposes these patterns and intermingles them with the impressions of the metal sculpture.

At first glance, the large and powerful, white sculpture represents a portrait of a subdued young girl with closed eyes, 'The Key of the piece is the soul of the piece' focused on the interior of the earth and the souls of the people. The head is the most important part of our body is because it's the palace of dreams, the palace of wisdom, the palace of our more important questions. And that head for me, sits like a beautiful box in where we keep the most important secrets, the most important dreams, the most important invisible things in our life- What is Beauty? Everyone has the capacity to feel it. And I guess it's not directed to one or another culture, one or another colour of skin, one or another religion. No, beauty is beauty', states Plensa. Created with polyester resin and marble dust, this sculpture situated over eight meters high enhances the architectural narrative of Oxford's dynamic buildings; Plensa notes that 'It's the biggest piece I ever did as a single object - I've never done a piece as a single piece like this.' Plensa's public works create spaces for inner-reflection amidst the bustle of everyday life and dissolve boundaries, opening up community interaction. Plensa incorporates human connection, silence, self-identification and light into each of his unique works, bringing humanity to look inwards at their own beauty and become closer to one-another than ever before: 'I still remember Brancusi was talking about creating. And he said something probably very beautiful. He said, the importance is not to do. The importance is to feel the capacity to do it. And when you have that feeling, you create as a God, you order as a general, and you work as a slave. And I think that is key for the artist, no? This amazing energy when you feel that you are with the capacity to do it. And then you must do it'  - Jaume Plensa. JAUME PLENSA  Internationally celebrated Spanish artist Jaume Plensa (b. 1955) is one of the world's foremost sculptors working in the public realm with celebrated projects spanning the globe in such cities as Calgary, Chicago, San Diego, Montreal, London, Paris, Dubai, Bangkok, Shanghai, and Tokyo.

As a public artwork, Mixer is monumental in scale - visible from afar and instantly recognizable - but it is also open and intimate, inviting visitors to experience the artwork in the round. The inspiration for Mixer comes archival photographs of the Park Hyatt Roof Lounge, vernacularly known as the rooftop bar. I experienced this myself as an exceptional place to have a martini while I was living and studying Art History at Victoria College, U of T, a stone's throw away. It is impossible to think of the Park Hyatt Hotel without recalling this space; its new incarnation is now keenly anticipated. Populated by guests, locals, and cultural luminaries alike, and tended by legendary bartenders poised before an array of glowing bottles filled with fine spirits, the Park Hyatt bar has epitomized hospitality, expert mixology, and an atmosphere of gregarious encounter. Mixer finds shape and form in the famously lavish display of bottles behind the bar, with their glowing flasks of amber encased in glass. Here, vessel and human form lean into each other, evoking the Park Hyatt's legendary history, evoking industrial, artisinal, and organic forms culled from glassware, receptacles, and couture. The forms also summon the artistic legacy of the British sculptor Henry Moore, a seminal figure in the history of the modern era in Toronto. His work The Archer was installed at Toronto City Hall in 1966, inspiring heated debate on the cultural identity of the city, defining once and for all its receptiveness to new ideas as an emerging international metropolis.

I thought of a particular text that Buckminster Fuller had written about the origins of the roof. Fuller traced the origin of the roof to the skeleton of the whale. As he saw it the cavity / skeleton of the whale was the model on which early wood boats were made - think about the spine, ribs and planking of a boat like the anatomy of a whale. And early explorers used their upturned boats as ideal cover/shelter in new terrain and thus the inverted boat became a precursor to the modern roof - beams, planks and ridge board.  So with this transformation in mind I became keenly interested in the Great Lake freight boats, Lakers, as they are called that have essentially been made obsolete in the wake of the changing demographic of the down town core. According to Fuller this was the natural progression from the natural -> utility -> settlement. The ship, a relic of an earlier time, has yielded to buildings like the one it stands before and is left to the viewer whether Ballast is rising from or sinking into the ground below. My hopes are that the architecture of Ballast will also create a social space, where residents of this area can contemplate these issues and children can play and discover.Artist Statement.""",None,Great Gulf,None,landscape,None,None,"{'type': 'MultiPoint', 'coordinates': [[-79.393716, 43.645817]]}"

It finds its inspiration in the folded paper dymaxion maps developed by the late American architect, Buckminster Fuller, to represent our world as one island in one ocean. At the same time, the work refers to a crucial moment in 1967-68 when the first early images of space exploration returned to earth, changing our perception of space, cartography, and the unknown, reminders of our lonely planet's splendid isolation and delicate fragility.",None,Monarch Development Corporation,None,portrait,None,None,"{'type': 'MultiPoint', 'coordinates': [[-79.336741, 43.775334]]}"

The Unicorn and the Frog are both powerful icons from traditional and popular culture. They promise protection, good health, prosperity and wealth.

The artwork was inspired by a photograph from the 1920s showing the word MOTH written in large white letters on the turf beside the original Downsview airstrip. The sculpture's stone sections of varying heights, which also serve as tables and seating, coalesce into the letters M,O,T,H when seen from above. A vine covered steel arbour at the west side of the gardens incorporates various aircraft references. A row of windsocks marks the park's eastern end. The central grassy ""airstrip"" is defined by a line of blue solar runway lights and blue LED light strips attached under the stones cast a soft blue outline around the MOTH letters at night. Each letter of the MOTH sculpture is surrounded by a unique garden. These rose, flowering annual, scented herb and butterfly gardens are intersected by walkways patterned on Italian Renaissance garden designs in recognition of the area's early Italian immigrants.
